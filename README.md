# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges

The challenge I faced was figuring out how to set multiple profiles. At first I had made the function with profiles, but after catching a few bugs (and some internet dig up/rewatching the recommended video), I was succesful!
